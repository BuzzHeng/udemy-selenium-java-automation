Create Page Object Class for LoginScreen and migrate the test

Implementing Action Methods for PageFactory Web Elements to implement logic

Create Abstract Component to reuse common methods/code
in framework

From child to parent class
Can sent by using super() keyword

super() â†’ Used to call and pass values to the parent class constructor from the child.


Reusable element should be in AbstractComponents Class

Assertion/Validation should only be in Test

PageObject only should have actions

Reduce initializing PageObject in test by chaining.

[ PageObject Chaining - Cleaner and more readable test flow ]
- Reduce new PageObject(driver) in tests
- Return next PageObject in methods
[ Example ]
```java
CartPage cart = new LoginPage(driver)
        .login("user", "pass")
        .addToCart();
```
[ Method Format ]
```java
public ProductPage login(String user, String pass){
    return new ProductPage(driver);
}
```
